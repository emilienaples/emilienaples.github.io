## UN Data - A Statistical Analysis in R
-------------

For this study done with a colleague in my master's degree, we chose the [Country Statistics - UNData](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/undata-country-profiles) dataset on the different countries of the world with several indicators that cover four main fields: general information, economy, sociology and environment/infrastructure indicators. An in-depth data and statistical analysis is performed to extract meaningful insights from the data.
